Command Line Caesar Cipher


## Project description

A Caesar cipher is an encoder and decoder tool. The encoder takes input from users and
substitutes each letter by shifting it a certain number of places down the alphabet based on the input key provided by the user. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. The decoder works by reversing the encryption based on the key used in encryption.
